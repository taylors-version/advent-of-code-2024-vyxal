# advent-of-code-2024-vyxal
Here's my attempt to solve as much of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) as I can in [Vyxal](https://vyxal.github.io/)

### How to run
Most solutions should be runnable in the [online IDE](https://vyxal.github.io/latest.html) Simply put the code in the section headed by "Bytes", create a new input group and enter your input.  
Some solutions might not run on the online IDE, in which case you'll need to download and build the latest version locally. See the [build](https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal/blob/version-3/contributing/Building.md) documentation for this.  
To run the tests, copy any test into the [online IDE](https://vyxal.github.io/latest.html) and 1 should be output (note: separate tests are separated by `##comments`)

### meta.md
Each day will try to have a meta.md file. This will say how many bytes I've got each solution down to with a link to running it (you will need to enter your input manually).  
I will also try to include an explanation of how the code works.


### Running byte count
6 stars, 236 bytes = 39.3 avg
