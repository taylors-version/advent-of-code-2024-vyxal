# advent-of-code-2024-vyxal
Here's my attempt to solve as much of Advent of Code 2024 as I can in [Vyxal](https://vyxal.github.io/)

### How to run
Most solutions should be runnable in the [online IDE](https://vyxal.github.io/latest.html) Simply put the code in the section headed by "Bytes", create a new input group and enter your input.  
Some solutions might not run on the online IDE, in which case you'll need to download and build the latest version locally. See the [build](https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal/blob/version-3/contributing/Building.md) documentation for this.
